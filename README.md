Single Page Application with MVC and SammyJS

Introduction

Traditional web applications reside mostly on the server, with heavy traffic flow between browser and server using GETs, POSTs (and in webforms, the dreaded postback) being the order of the day. More and more web applications are using a new paradigm, the Single Page Application or "SPA".

Common examples of SPAs are Facebook and Gmail. The concept of an SPA is to keep provide a better, more responsive, seamless experience for the user, so that they seldom have to leave the browser and therefore avoid long tedious full page refresh round-trips to the server. Frameworks like Angular provide extremely robust methods for creating SPAs, but when you don't have the time for the learning curve, or want something that's light-weight and works simply, a very focused router like SammyJS is an extremely useful alternative. This article introduces the benefits of using an SPA router and explains how to use SammyJS to quickly put together a clean, scalable, modular single page application with MVC.
